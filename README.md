## 👤 About Me

I’m a passionate Business & Data Analyst seeking to drive strategic impact through data. I earned my Master’s in Business Analytics from [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu)’s W. P. Carey School of Business in May 2025, receiving a $5,000 International Scholarship. My coursework in **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Unstructured Data Analytics**, **AI & Data Analytics Strategy**, and more, alongside my BS in Computer Science , equips me to tackle complex challenges.I’m fueled by curiosity and a global perspective. My experience spans both technical and business-facing analytics projects, including:
- 📦 **Demand Forecasting for Avnet** – Applied **Python** and **XGBoost** to increase forecast accuracy by 35% and support strategic supply chain decisions  
- 🛍 **Sentiment Analysis of Shopping Reviews** – Leveraged **NLTK** and **AWS SageMaker** for text classification and trend insights, boosting campaign targeting effectiveness  
- 🏘 **Community Complaint Analysis (City of Phoenix)** – Used **Python** and **Seaborn** to visualize complaint patterns and support city maintenance strategies  
- 📈 **Stanley Market Positioning & Perception Analysis** – Conducted a survey-based study across 7 product attributes with 120+ college students. Created perceptual maps, SWOT analysis, and competitive benchmarks vs. Yeti, Hydro Flask, and ThermoFlask. Delivered 4 Gen Z-focused marketing strategies, applying Excel and PowerPoint for analytics and storytelling

These projects sharpened my skills in **Python**, **SQL**, **Power BI**, **Tableau**, **Excel**, and **AWS**, and strengthened my ability to connect analytics to business strategy. I’ve also gained experience in **market research**, **consumer perception modeling**, and **data-driven marketing**.

I’m curious by nature, always exploring tools like **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, **NLTK**, and **Airflow** to stay at the cutting edge of data and business analytics.
Outside of work, I enjoy swimming, soccer, strength training, volleyball, skydiving, and adventure travel.
